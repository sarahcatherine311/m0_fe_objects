# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
    Just trying to retain the new syntax for objects.
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
    Note taking it going well. I try to take notes during the sessions, but find it most productive to take notes when I read them on my own.
- What are you noticing that you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
    Trying to solve a problem on my own first. Googling is way too confusing and rarely lends me very useful information.
